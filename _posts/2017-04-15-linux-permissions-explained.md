In linux, every file or folder has access permissions. Linux file permissions are **9** bits of information (3 types x 3 type of users)

**Permissions are defined for 3 types of users:**

	- (u)Owner of the file 
    - (g)Group the owner belongs
    - (o)Other users
    
`u` is the user's permissions, `g` is the group's permissions & `o` other, can be any number between 0-7

**Chmod Octal, Binary & Meaning:**
read (r), write (w), execute (x); the dash (â€“) means no permission.

| Octal | Read | Write | Execute | Binary | Meaning |
| :------ |:----| :---- | :---- | :------ | :------ |
| 7 | r | w | x | 1 1 1 | Full permissions	|
| 6 | r | w | - | 1 1 0 | Read & write only	|
| 5 | r | - | x | 1 0 1 | Read & execute only	|
| 4 | r | - | - | 1 0 0 | Read only	|
| 3 | - | w | x | 0 1 1 | Write & execute only	|
| 2 | - | w | - | 0 1 0 | Write only	|
| 1 | - | - | x | 0 0 1 | Execute only	|
| 0 | - | - | - | 0 0 0 | No permissions	|
    
**View Permissions:**

`$ls -l` -- List items in current directory and show permissions.
 
`$ls -l [path]` -- Path also can be specified as an option.

**Setting Permissions with chmod:** Syntax below

`$chmod [permission] [path for file or folder]`

where `[permission]` can be either octal or symbolic notation e.g:

```
chmod 077 foo.sh   # octal
chmod +x bar.sh    # symbolic
```
